# k-means Clustering Exploration

The k-means algorithm can be used to find clusters in a dataset using only an initial guess of the number of clusters. 
By alternating between two steps, the algorithm gradually learns more reasonable centers for each cluster until a steady 
state is reached. This is known as the *expectation-maximization algorithm*. In this jupyter notebook, you will apply 
k-means to two sets of data and think about the pros and cons of the k-means algorithm. At the end you will apply k-means 
to images where you will segment an image by grouping similarly colored pixels in an image.

If you don't have python or jupyter notebooks installed, then you can try to use jupyter lab through a web browser. 
Click this link: https://jupyter.org/try and navigate to JupyterLab to get started.
If you go with this approach, then make sure you upload the datasets and files from this repository to jupyter lab
before running the notebook file.
