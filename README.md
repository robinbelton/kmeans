# k-means Clustering Exploration

Clone this repository and then work through the exercises in the jupyter notebook to learn more about k-means.
If you don't have python or jupyter notebooks installed, then you can try to use jupyter lab through a web browser. 
Click this link: https://jupyter.org/try and navigate to JupyterLab.
If you go with this approach, then make sure you upload the datasets and files from this repository to jupyter lab
before running the notebook file. 

Please reach out to me (Robin Belton) via email: rbelton@smith.edu with any questions or concerns.
